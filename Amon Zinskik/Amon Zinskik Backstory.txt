Amon grew up in Fairhaven. His parents, Eremon and Salome (both tieflings) served the cabal of the Lords of Dust that serves Sul Khatesh.

As a young boy Amon was taught how to blend into a crowd using disguises and body language in order to avoid suspicion. When he came of age he pledged himself to Sul Khatesh and began study of the powers granted to him by his new overlord.

He found that he was able to learn these arcane powers easily and quickly surpassed his parents power. The higher ups in his cabal took him to the Demon Wastes to study under a Rakshasa named Takrash.

While studying there they attempted to manipulate and groom him into becoming a blind follower of Sul Khatesh. While not a fanatic, Amon did realise the immense power that he had recieved and was continuing to gain through his studies, and so played along with the Lords of Dust.

Throughout his years serving the Lords of Dust he has been sent on many missions:

	-To make contact with Josia'h, an elf infiltrator in the church of the Silver Flame. Amon learned a lot on this mission, including a basic layout of Flamekeep and the Grand Cathedral.
	- To assist in a ritual in (city). The ritual was a master level spell and needed the bloodletting from several gifted members of the cabal, and was meant to help weaken the membrane between the planes. Although Amon did not do anything but observe and give a few drops of blood, he got to know nine other gifted members like himself from around the continent which had gathered for this ritual.
	- To gather intel on a Queen. The cult meant to replace the queen and needed to know the ins and outs of her daily life and interactions. Amon was one of several cabal members who analysed her daily life and reported to the Lords of Dust. Last he heard, they were sucessful in replacing her.
	- To capture a lesser demon. Whilst this was more of a training mission, Amon needed to understand the consequences of summoning if he was not prepared enough to contain that which he had summoned. Another cabal member, Erish, had summoned a lesser demon which quickly overpowered her and was on a rampage. Whilst it had not caught the attention of anyone serious yet, it was only a matter of time before news got to the Church of the silver flame and they were sniffing around. Amon needed to either contain, kill or banish the demon before it did too much damage. The mission involved him going to (town/keep ruins/small city) and meeting Erish, whom he worked with to track down the demon. He laid an ambush for it and managed to send it back to the demonic plane without too much going wrong. Erish is now one of his closest friends in the cabal.

Even though he is not privy to the prophecy that will bring about the return of the overlords, he is aware that the missions he is sent on further this goal. But he figures that the return of the overlords is very unlikely to happen in his lifetime and therefore there is no harm in using his position to gain power for himself.
