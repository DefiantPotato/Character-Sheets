Amon grew up in Fairhaven. His parents, Eremon and Salome (both tieflings) served the cabal of the Lords of Dust that serves Sul Khatesh.

As a young boy Amon was taught how to blend into a crowd using disguises and body language in order to avoid suspicion. When he came of age he pledged himself to Sul Khatesh and began study of the powers granted to him by his new overlord.

He found that he was able to learn these arcane powers easily and quickly surpassed his parents power. The higher ups in his cabal took him to the Demon Wastes to study under a Rakshasa named Takrash.

While studying there they attempted to manipulate and groom him into becoming a blind follower of Sul Khatesh. While not a fanatic, Amon did realise the immense power that he had recieved and was continuing to gain through his studies, and so played along with the Lords of Dust.



Even though he is not privy to the prophecy that will bring about the return of the overlords, he is aware that the missions he is sent on further this goal. But he figures that the return of the overlords is very unlikely to happen in his lifetime and therefore there is no harm in using his position to gain power for himself.
