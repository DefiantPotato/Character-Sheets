Bugrash grew up in the shadow marches, his family dedicated to fighting off the daelkyr. His tribe put a lot of importance in strength and combat prowress which Bugrash detested, he preferred to bring joy to his tribe mates with tasty food. As he practised his craft he disovered that he as able to imbue magical properties into the food he cooked. Eventually he was fed up with being ridiculed and mistreated for his lack of strength and stuck out on his own to see what new and exciting ingredients are available to experiment with.

His more primal upbringing has instilled a strong instinct to not waste any source of potential food. This has lead to more than one occasion where he has received scorn and judgement for cooking with what could be considered "undesirable" ingredients.
